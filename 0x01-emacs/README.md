# A journey through some of Emacs' commands

Emacs is so much more than a text editor, so much so that some people have labeled it an operating system.

It allows us to do things like: support for multiple languages (natural and computer), can be used as an IDE, is able to compare the differences between two files, works as a file manager, can read news/mail/RSS feeds or used to play Tetris.

Such an awesome piece of software engineering!
